    "P4-121": "An 18-year-old stepped off a train in Kansas City in 1910 with almost no money — just two shoeboxes of postcards. A fire in 1915 destroyed everything he'd built and left him $17,000 in debt. He rebuilt anyway, and that company became Hallmark, the biggest greeting card company in America.",
    "P4-122": "Two brothers started this company in a small Kansas City office in 1955 — and they literally changed how their last name was spelled (from Bloch to Block) on the sign, just so people wouldn't mispronounce it into a joke.",
    "P4-123": "A soap and candle maker bought a struggling, nearly-failing brewery almost as an afterthought in 1860. His son-in-law joined a few years later and turned it into one of the biggest beverage companies on the planet.",

    "P2-014": "This whole sawmill site was completely lost and forgotten for almost 100 years until someone stumbled across it in 1972. Peak 'we found it in the woods' energy.",
    "P2-015": "In 1763, warriors got inside this exact fort by starting a lacrosse game outside the walls — the ball 'accidentally' went over, and the second the gate opened for it, the attack started. Sports as a Trojan horse. Unreal move.",
    "P2-016": "This lighthouse got fired from its job because a bridge showed up with brighter lights. In 1957, the Mackinac Bridge basically said 'I got this' and the lighthouse got switched off.",
    "P2-017": "The bridge is engineered to sway up to 35 feet sideways in high wind. On purpose. Totally safe. Extremely uncomfortable to think about while driving across it.",
    "P2-018": "This icebreaker ship was built in WWII specifically to smash through ice so war supplies could keep moving. Sailors nicknamed her 'Queen of the Great Lakes.' You can walk through the actual engine room.",
    "P2-019": "One of the first ten spots on the ENTIRE PLANET officially recognized as a Dark Sky Park. This far north, you can sometimes catch the actual northern lights. No filter required.",
    "P2-020": "Over 26 miles of totally undeveloped shoreline. No hotels, no shops, nothing. Just water and quiet, which is either peaceful or deeply suspicious depending on your personality.",
    "P2-021": "This lighthouse was basically forgotten by the public for decades until historians rediscovered what it even was. A lighthouse. Lost. In plain sight. On the shore. Sure.",
    "P2-023": "This isn't even a normal lighthouse tower — it's a light sitting on a square wooden platform built right in the water. One of the last ones of its kind left on the Great Lakes.",
    "P2-024": "Built in 1877 by a frontier lumber town that apparently decided, mid-wilderness, that what they really needed was a nice theater. Burned down. Rebuilt anyway. Commitment.",
    "P2-025": "In real bad winters, people skip the ferry entirely and drive their actual cars across the frozen lake on an ice road marked with dead Christmas trees frozen upright in the ice. This is not fiction. This is Tuesday for some people.",
    "P2-026": "This island didn't get electricity until 1964. Somewhere out here someone did their homework by candlelight and nobody thought that was weird yet.",
    "P2-028": "A lighthouse has stood on this exact spot since 1829 — one of the oldest on the entire Great Lakes — though storms have taken out more than one version of it over the centuries. Persistence, but make it a building.",
    "P2-030": "Tiny island airport where planes land next to deer and wild turkeys just casually standing on the runway edge like they pay rent there.",
    "P2-031": "One of the last one-room schoolhouses still operating in the entire state. Every grade, one room, one teacher. No hallway drama possible — there's no hallway.",
    "P2-034": "A 146-foot natural stone arch you can only reach by walking, biking, or horse carriage, because cars are banned on this entire island. Mackinac Island said no thank you to cars over a century ago and never looked back.",
    "P2-035": "This museum sits on the site of a 17th-century mission and burial ground — meaning people have considered this exact spot important for roughly 400 years straight.",
    "P3-001": "Freighters up to 1,000 feet long get raised or lowered 21 feet right in front of you because Lake Superior just sits that much higher than Lake Huron. Basically a giant, extremely slow elevator for boats.",
    "P3-002": "The waterfall is legitimately root-beer colored with tan foam on top. It's not pollution, it's tree tannins, and it looks exactly like a giant root beer float that someone left running for 200 years.",
    "P3-003": "They have the actual bell off the Edmund Fitzgerald — the freighter that sank with all 29 crew in 1975, the one from that Gordon Lightfoot song. Pulled up from 530 feet down, 20 years later. Heavy stop. Worth it.",
    "P3-004": "A 200-foot limestone tower you climb via staircase for one of the best bridge views around. Local legend says a chief once used it as a lookout. Also a great excuse to make everyone else climb stairs while you narrate the legend dramatically.",
    "P3-005": "Balls appear to roll uphill here. It's a 1950s optical-illusion tourist trap and it's fully aware of what it is. Respect the hustle.",
    "P3-010": "3.2 million bricks were laid down here in 1909 — that's why it's called 'The Brickyard.' One tiny strip of the original bricks is still exposed at the finish line, just sitting there being historically significant while everyone drives over it at 200 mph.",
    "P3-017": "Free museum, has its own planetarium, also covers the actual 1980 tornado that ripped straight through downtown Kalamazoo. Free AND slightly terrifying. A combo.",
    "P3-021": "This place has over 300 sculptures and one of the biggest tropical greenhouses in the state. Somebody's grocery-store fortune paid for all of it, which is either inspiring or extremely on brand for capitalism.",
    "P3-023": "Guarded by a lighthouse nicknamed 'Big Red' that gets photographed more than most celebrities. It has its own fan club, basically.",
    "P3-024": "A real, working 250-year-old Dutch windmill shipped over in pieces and rebuilt here. So somewhere there's a windmill-shaped hole in the Netherlands' skyline and nobody talks about it.",
    "P3-026": "The only place in Michigan where driving a dune buggy straight up a sand dune is not just legal, it's the whole point. 450 acres dedicated to controlled chaos.",
    "P3-027": "This lighthouse was never painted white like the others — it's still bare brick from 1874. Everyone else got a makeover, this one just said no.",
    "P3-028": "You have to hike 1.5 miles along the beach just to reach this lighthouse. No shortcuts, no parking lot next to it. It makes you earn the view, which feels aggressive for a building.",
    "P3-030": "Local legend says this dune is a mother bear who swam Lake Michigan escaping a fire and waited for her two cubs, who never made it — the two islands offshore are supposedly them. Heavy lore for a pile of sand, but here we are.",
    "P3-031": "Built in the 1960s by a lumberman so people who didn't want to hike could still see the view. Some overlooks drop 400 feet straight down. Built for lazy people, terrifying for everyone.",
    "P3-033": "A literal 1918 castle built to be... a dairy farm. The Beach Boys played concerts here before it became a wedding venue. Genuinely unclear how any of those sentences connect, but they do.",
    "P3-034": "You can hunt for real 350-million-year-old fossilized coral here — it's called a Petoskey stone and it basically only exists in this one part of Michigan. Free souvenir, older than dinosaurs.",
    "P3-043": "The Wright brothers didn't just fly once at Kitty Hawk and retire — they came back to Dayton and spent two more years quietly perfecting actual controlled flight in a random field here. The famous moment wasn't even the hard part.",
    "P3-044": "Largest military aviation museum on the planet, and it's free. They have an SR-71 Blackbird — the fastest jet ever built, one that could straight up outrun a missile fired at it.",
    "P3-047": "A children's museum built inside an actual old mansion. You can still spot the bones of the original house hiding inside the exhibits if you look.",
    "P3-049": "Ulysses S. Grant lived on this exact land and built this cabin with his own hands years before becoming a general or president. Pre-fame Grant, doing manual labor. Humbling for everyone involved, presumably including him.",
    "P3-050": "You can drive right through free-roaming elk and bison here. No fences between you and them. Your car window is the only thing standing between vacation and a very different kind of vacation.",
    "P3-051": "This park sits on top of a town called Times Beach that was so contaminated with toxic chemicals in the 1980s the entire town had to be evacuated and bulldozed. So enjoy the park, built on the ashes of an actual ghost town, but the legal kind.",
    "P3-052": "The Meramec Caverns guy offered farmers free barn paint jobs across 14 states just to advertise this cave. He also basically invented the bumper sticker. Marketing has never recovered.",
    "P3-055": "Mark Twain explored a cave like this as a kid and used it as the basis for the scary cave scenes in Tom Sawyer. So somewhere down there is the OG inspiration for a book you were probably assigned in school.",
    "P3-056": "This is the real house Twain grew up in, and that famous fence-painting scene in Tom Sawyer is based on the actual fence out front. Tricking your friends into doing your chores: also historically accurate.",
    "P3-057": "Walt Disney lived in this tiny town as a kid, and Main Street USA at every single Disney park in the world is modeled after the actual street outside this museum. So yes, the happiest place on earth is secretly based on rural Missouri.",
    "P3-058": "General John J. Pershing, who commanded the entire U.S. military in WWI, grew up in this small house. Small-town kid, absurdly high ceiling for career growth.",
    "P3-059": "The Battle of Westport in 1864 was the biggest Civil War battle west of the Mississippi. Over 30,000 soldiers fought across what's now just... normal suburban Kansas City neighborhoods. Someone's driveway is probably a battlefield.",
    "P3-062": "The scoreboard and fountains at this stadium have been running since 1973. That's over 50 years of the same water feature doing its thing between innings without a single day off.",
    "P3-063": "This stadium set the actual Guinness World Record for loudest outdoor stadium ever — 142.2 decibels. That's louder than a jet taking off. From a crowd. Yelling.",
    "P2-022": "Hidden in this park are the ruins of an 1859 lighthouse most people drive right past without ever knowing it's back there. History, but make it a secret side quest.",
    "P2-027": "The island's museum and library keep the story of a town that still has no traffic light, no chain store, and about 70 year-round residents. Small town energy, but genuinely small.",
    "P2-029": "Home to Michigan's actual state wildflower, which grows almost nowhere else on Earth except right here on Great Lakes shorelines. Look, don't pick. It's basically a celebrity plant.",
    "P2-032": "Cars have been banned on this entire island since 1898 because one automobile scared the horses. One car. That's all it took. The island held a grudge for over a century.",
    "P2-033": "Soldiers stationed here got maybe one bath a week if they were lucky, and their wool uniforms basically never got washed. History looked cool in movies. History smelled terrible.",
    "P3-006": "Over 1,000 people escaping slavery passed safely through this house — it earned the nickname 'Grand Central Station' of the Underground Railroad, and nobody who stayed here was ever caught.",
    "P3-007": "Some of these trees started growing in the 1600s, before the United States existed. They've been standing here quietly judging every historical event since.",
    "P3-008": "A whole town built its identity around roses. The hospital's named after roses. The streets are named after roses. Someone really committed to a theme.",
    "P3-009": "This small-town museum has an actual Egyptian mummy in it. Nobody expects that walking in, which is exactly why it's worth the stop.",
    "P3-011": "Largest children's museum on the planet, and it has real dinosaur fossils and a real space capsule. Somehow still marketed primarily to people under age 10.",
    "P3-012": "The building itself is made from 792 different types of stone and brick, one from every county in the state. So the museum is technically also a rock collection the size of a building.",
    "P3-013": "Real Native American and Western art and artifacts, no replicas. The kind of museum that makes 'field trip' sound like it's underselling itself.",
    "P3-014": "Everyone working here is in character playing it's still 1836. Ask them what year it is and they will not break. Commitment to the bit, professionally.",
    "P3-015": "The African exhibit lets giraffes and zebras roam one shared space like an actual savanna. No cages in sight, which is either impressive design or slightly concerning depending on how close you get.",
    "P3-016": "Three totally different climates — rainforest, desert, and a rotating garden — under one glass roof, a few feet apart from each other. Somebody's HVAC system is working overtime.",
    "P3-018": "Over 1,100 acres of forest and wetland with an actual 1858 farmstead sitting in the middle of it. Old house, older trees.",
    "P3-019": "You can hand-feed a giraffe here. A giraffe. With your actual hand. No, it will not ask permission first.",
    "P3-020": "There's a fully working 1928 carousel inside the museum. You can ride a century-old carousel indoors, which is either charming or a liability lawyer's nightmare.",
    "P3-022": "This zoo sits inside a park a farmer donated to the city over a century ago, specifically so everyone could use it for free forever. Rare example of a rich guy actually following through.",
    "P3-025": "Guarded by a lighthouse connected to shore by a raised catwalk, built so keepers could reach the light without getting swept off the pier during Lake Michigan's worst storms. Job requirements included 'not dying in a storm.'",
    "P3-029": "The lighthouse sits at the very end of a long concrete pier stretching into Lake Michigan. Walking all the way out feels dramatic. It is, in fact, just a pier.",
    "P3-032": "This light guards one of the narrowest, trickiest boat channels on the whole Great Lakes. Big boats, small gap, no margin for error.",
    "P3-035": "A 20-mile road so narrow and tree-covered it feels like driving through a tunnel. Locals have fought for decades to keep it exactly this unpaved and inconvenient, on purpose.",
    "P3-036": "This estate belonged to the family who invented the Ball glass jar — yes, the same jars people still use to can pickles today. So somewhere in your kitchen there might be a tiny piece of this place.",
    "P3-037": "There are Native American ceremonial mounds here built around 160 BC. That's nearly 2,000 years before Columbus. Older than basically anything else you'll see on this entire trip.",
    "P3-038": "This is the actual gym from the movie Hoosiers. You can shoot free throws on the exact court. Extremely low odds you'll play as well as the movie made it look.",
    "P3-039": "This Hall of Fame sits in the town with the largest high school gym in the entire world — it seats over 9,000 people. More than some actual college arenas. For high schoolers. Playing basketball.",
    "P3-040": "Same house as the other Coffin site on this route — over 1,000 people escaping slavery came through here safely. Nobody who hid here was ever caught. Not once.",
    "P3-041": "This town used to build its own cars before Ford's Model T existed. So technically, this random Indiana town beat Henry Ford to the punch and history just... didn't care.",
    "P3-042": "A tiny record label here recorded some of the earliest jazz and country music in America. Legends like Louis Armstrong cut some of their first records in this small Indiana town nobody's heard of.",
    "P3-045": "They have a real 1905 Wright Flyer here — the plane the Wright brothers themselves considered their first genuinely practical aircraft. Not a replica. The actual plane.",
    "P3-046": "Hundreds of acres of restored prairie and an actual working farm combined into one place. Somewhere in there is probably a chicken with main character energy.",
    "P3-048": "Over 60 giant sculptures scattered across 105 acres of open land. You will be walking along minding your business and suddenly there's a 15-foot metal sculpture just standing there.",
    "P3-053": "Early explorers reportedly stole boats just to paddle underground and see this cave before anyone else could claim they found it first. People will do anything to be first.",
    "P3-054": "An enormous abandoned lead-mining complex you can walk through, original 1907 machinery still sitting exactly where it was left. Nobody cleaned up after themselves. History left the mess for us.",
    "P3-060": "A recreated 1920s town where the buildings are either genuinely historic or careful rebuilds. Real Prohibition-era drugstore, real one-room schoolhouse, zero actual Prohibition enforced.",
    "P3-061": "The main exhibit is an entire real 1950s suburban house you walk through room by room. It's basically a time machine disguised as a museum wing.",
    "P3-064": "This garden includes the largest edible garden in the country — a whole section built just to show people where food actually comes from. Revolutionary concept, apparently.",
    "P3-065": "This one-day battle in 1862 was one of the bloodiest of the entire Civil War in Missouri — over 200 soldiers killed or wounded in just a few hours. Small town, brutal afternoon."
